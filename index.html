                    <p>This dashboard displays earthquakes recorded within and around the United States from the start of 1900 until October 2021. 
                        Some recorded earthquakes have no deaths attributed to it or any damage recorded and as such are left empty.

                    <h3>Earthquakes in USA (1900-2021)</h3>
                    <p>This proportional symbol map displays all recorded earthquakes with the U.S. between 1900 and 2021. 
                        The large majority of the earthquakes can be seen to be focused around the coast of the western
                         United States, around Hawaii and Alaska. This is largely due to the fault lines that run through
                          the regions, such as the San Andreas Fault that extends through California's coastline.
                        The largest concentration of high magnitude earthquakes can be seen to be off the Alaskan Peninsula</p>

                <h3>Earthquake Trends</h3>
                <p>This visualisation displays all recorded earthquakes' magnitude against the year of their occurrence. Also displayed is the linear regression line calculated from the magnitude of the recorded earthquakes.
                    This line can be seen to trend downwards, suggesting that measurement instruments such as seismometers are
                     becoming more sensitive and that more measurement stations have possibly been created, specifically in areas where quakes aren't common.

                <h3>Deaths & Destruction</h3>
                <p>The two bar charts below display the top 10 deadliest earthquakes to be recorded within the United States.
                    The charts outline how deadly the quake was, and how much destruction each quake caused. It also illustrates
                     the independence of an earthquakes' damages to its lethality. The primary state where these quakes have occurred can 
                     be seen to be California, suggesting its population density and development of cities surround fault lines are to blame.</p>
